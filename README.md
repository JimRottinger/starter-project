This is a template for a generic Node/Angular client/server project.  If you would like to create a project starting from this template, do the following:

    git clone git@github.com:aminer-looker/starter-project <your project name>
    cd <your project name
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "initial commit"

Now you'll have a brand new project which has its own separate repository, and is ready to be connected to a new GitHub repo (if you so choose).  In that case, go ahead and create your repository, and then run the following command:

    git remote add origin git@github.com:<your GitHub username>/<your new repo name>.git
    git push -u origin master

Now, your new repository will contain the contents of your started project, and you're ready to start working!
